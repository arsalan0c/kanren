# µKanren in OCaml
 
[µKanren](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf) is an embedded domain specific language for relational programming. It is part of family of such languages known as [*kanrens*](http://minikanren.org), with a focus on being minimalist and easy to understand - its original implementation in Scheme consists of less than 40 lines! While this is at the expense of expressiveness, the core system can be augmented with additional operators, built on top of the primitives (as in this implementation).
